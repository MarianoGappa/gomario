# gomario
Basic Golang text-mode Mario-like game - My first Go program

![Screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Instructions to compile-run
```
cd ~/workspace && git clone git@github.com:MarianoGappa/gomario.git
cd gomario
go run main.go
# Reach the red square!
```

## Disclaimer
Mostly works; there is some race condition on gravity checking vs moving that sometimes makes Mario fall off perfectly good floors :P
